## Conference Bio

Mark is currently Principal UI Engineer for Orbitz Worldwide. At Orbitz, he leads the development of the presentation layer for their family of travel websites around the globe. He focuses on building interactive and usable interfaces which follow web standards and are accessible. He is a client-side developer at heart, but spends a lot of his time finding better ways for the presentation layer to play well inside large web
applications. 

Previously, Mark was Technology Director for Critical Mass where he led site development and architecture for numerous clients. He got his start on the web at Encyclopaedia Britannica by helping to launch Britannica.com. He has an undergraduate degree from St. Norbert College and earned a Masters in Software Engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology.
